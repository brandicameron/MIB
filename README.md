## Things Learned:

&nbsp;<br>

- Had to figure out how to make images of alien characters display inside the form input.
- It was also fun getting each alien character to correspond to a different letter or number, and pulling that info from data files.
- Styling the input to indicate an incorrect password was entered, then changing out components after password failure or time out.
- Gave me more practice using Router to redirect to a new webpage after having memory wiped. :)
- Hand created the lightburst in Photoshop, which will probably be a useful technique for many other things.
