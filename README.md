## Things Learned:

&nbsp;<br>

- First time using "Per Page Layouts" in next.js.
- Had to figure out how to make images of alien characters display inside the form input.
- Making each alien character to correspond to a different letter or number, and pulling that info from data files.
- Styling the input to indicate an incorrect password was entered, then changing out components after password failure or time out.
- More practice using Router to redirect to a new webpage after having memory wiped. ðŸ˜ƒ
- Creating a "space" sky with randomized stars that twinkle.
- Hand created the neuralyzer's lightburst in Photoshop, which will probably be a useful technique for many other things.
- Using pointer-events: none AND pointer-events: auto together to be able to click "through" an element. (ex: the frame)
- Making a custom designed range slider.
- That a clip path object can not have a border. :(
